# 1. Activity of Day 1: Introduction to Modeling and Fabrication Design

## Summary

Day 1 introduces the foundational concepts bridging design intent and physical reality. I explored the design-to-fabrication continuum and contemporary digital fabrication paradigms that shape modern making practices, then established the CO3 nameplate project scope.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the relationship between digital modeling and physical fabrication
- Learn the design-to-fabrication continuum: Design → Model → Prototype → Fabricate → Evaluate
- Identify key digital fabrication paradigms and their applications
- Recognize how fabrication methods shape design decisions from conception
- Set up professional documentation workflow using MkDocs

## 1. Introduction to Modeling and Fabrication

### Why Modeling & Fabrication Matter

Contemporary design practice has fundamentally shifted. Design today is computational, material-driven, and production-aware. Fabrication is no longer merely an end step—it actively shapes design decisions from the earliest conceptual stages.

**Key Applications:**
- **Architecture:** Parametric facades, robotically fabricated structures
- **Product Design:** Rapid prototyping, mass customization, user-centered iteration
- **Engineering:** Simulation-driven design, additive manufacturing
- **Research:** Physical computing, material experimentation, speculative design

### The Design-to-Fabrication Continuum

Design follows an iterative cycle, not a linear path:

```
Design → Model → Prototype → Fabricate → Evaluate → [Repeat]
```

**Critical Insight:** This process is iterative, not linear. Feedback occurs at every stage, and failure serves as a powerful learning tool.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Design** | Conceptualize and define intent, goals, and constraints |
| **Model** | Create digital representations encoding design logic |
| **Prototype** | Build physical tests to validate assumptions |
| **Fabricate** | Produce final artifacts using appropriate methods |
| **Evaluate** | Assess outcomes and gather learnings for next cycle |

### Digital Fabrication Paradigms

Contemporary fabrication methods fall into four primary categories:

#### Subtractive Fabrication
**Process:** Removing material from solid stock through cutting, milling, or drilling

**Technologies:** CNC milling, laser cutting, waterjet cutting, lathe turning

**Advantages:**
- High precision and accuracy
- Excellent surface finish
- Wide material compatibility

**Constraints:**
- Material waste
- Limited to 2.5D without multi-axis machines
- Tool access limitations

**Materials:** Wood, metals, plastics, foam, composites

#### Additive Fabrication
**Process:** Building objects layer-by-layer through material deposition

**Technologies:** FDM/FFF, SLA/DLP, SLS, binder jetting, material jetting

**Advantages:**
- Complex geometries without additional cost
- Minimal material waste
- Design freedom and internal structures possible

**Constraints:**
- Visible layer lines
- Support structures required
- Material limitations
- Post-processing often needed

**Materials:** PLA, ABS, PETG, nylon, resins, metals (specialized), ceramics

#### Formative Fabrication
**Process:** Shaping material through force, heat, or pressure using molds

**Technologies:** Casting, vacuum forming, injection molding, bending, stamping, thermoforming

**Advantages:**
- Material efficiency
- High-volume production capability
- Organic, flowing forms

**Constraints:**
- Requires tooling/molds (upfront cost)
- Draft angles required
- Undercut limitations

**Materials:** Plastics, metals, concrete, composites, textiles, elastomers

#### Hybrid Fabrication
**Process:** Combining multiple fabrication paradigms sequentially or simultaneously

**Examples:**
- 3D printed molds for casting
- Additive + subtractive machining
- Laser-cut assembled components with 3D printed connectors

**Advantages:**
- Optimizes strengths of each method
- Increased geometric complexity
- Material diversity in single object

**Constraints:**
- Workflow complexity
- Multiple machines/skills required
- Alignment challenges

**Key Insight:** Fabrication method is a design choice, not an afterthought. The selected paradigm influences geometry, materiality, cost, sustainability, and aesthetic expression. Expert designers think through fabrication from the earliest conceptual stages.

## 2. Activity: Building Documentation Website with MkDocs

### Overview

I set up a documentation website using MkDocs with Material theme to record and showcase all course activities, design processes, and fabrication experiments. This documentation serves as both a learning tool and a professional portfolio.

**Documentation as Design Practice:** Documentation is not an afterthought—it is part of the design process itself. Through documenting work, you develop clarity of thought, communicate complex ideas, and contribute to the collective knowledge of the design community.

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Python 3.8 or later
# Download from https://www.python.org/

# Install MkDocs and Material theme
pip install mkdocs-material
```

**Requirements:**
- Python version 3.8 or later
- pip (Python package manager)

### Step 2: Create a New MkDocs Project

```bash
# Create new documentation project
mkdocs new fabrication-docs

# Move into project directory
cd fabrication-docs
```

This creates the following structure:
```
fabrication-docs/
├── mkdocs.yml
├── docs/
│   └── index.md
└── README.md
```

### Step 3: Enable the Material Theme

Edit `mkdocs.yml` to enable Material theme and configure basic settings:

```yaml
site_name: CO3 Nameplate Documentation
site_description: Foundations of Modeling & Fabrication
site_author: Your Name

theme:
  name: material
  palette:
    primary: blue
    accent: light-blue
```

### Step 4: Write Documentation Content

All documentation pages are written in Markdown format. Place files in the `docs/` directory:

```
docs/
├── index.md
├── Daily-Activity/
│   ├── day_1.md
│   ├── day_2.md
│   └── ...
├── images/
│   └── day_1/
│       └── ...
└── stylesheets/
    └── extra.css
```

### Step 5: Configure Navigation

Define site navigation in `mkdocs.yml` to organize pages hierarchically:

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Daily Activities:
    - Day 1: Daily-Activity/day_1.md
    - Day 2: Daily-Activity/day_2.md
    - Day 3: Daily-Activity/day_3.md
```

### Step 6: Preview the Website Locally

Run the development server to preview changes in real time:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to view your site. Changes auto-reload as you edit files.

### Step 7: Enable Material Features (Optional)

Add advanced Material theme features to `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
theme:
  features:
    - navigation.tabs
    - navigation.sections
    - toc.integrate
    - search.suggest
    - content.code.copy
```

### Step 8: Add Recommended Markdown Extensions

Enable markdown extensions for richer documentation:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - admonition
  - tables
  - attr_list
  - md_in_html
  - pymdownx.details
  - pymdownx.superfences
  - pymdownx.highlight
  - toc:
      permalink: true
```

### Step 9: Build the Static Website

Generate static HTML files for deployment:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This creates a `site/` directory containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files ready for hosting.

### Step 10: Deploy to GitHub Pages

Deploy your documentation website to GitHub Pages:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

**Prerequisites for Deployment:**
- Project must be in a Git repository
- Must have GitHub account and repository
- Requires write access to repository settings

**Alternative Deployment Options:**
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Local server
- Traditional web hosting
